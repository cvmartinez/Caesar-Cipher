# Caesar-Cipher
TODO-1:
[]Create a function called encrypt() that takes original_text and shift_amount as 2 inputs.

TODO-2:
[]Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the original_text forwards in the alphabet by the shift_amount and print the encrypted text.
You can use the built-in Python index() function to find out the position of an item in a list. e.g.

TODO-3:
[]Call the encrypt() function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.

TODO-4:
[]What happens if you try to shift the letter 'z' forwards by 9? Can you fix the code?

TODO-5:
[]Create a function called decrypt() that takes original_text and shift_amount as 2 inputs.

TODO-6:
[]Inside the decrypt() function, shift each letter of the original_text forwards in the alphabet backwards by the shift_amount and print the decrypted text.

TODO-7:
[]Combine the encrypt() and decrypt() functions into a single function called caesar(). Use the value of the user chosen direction variable to determine which functionality to use. Call the caesar function instead of encrypt/decrypt and pass in all three variables direction/text/shift.

TODO-8:
[]Import and print the logo from art.py when the program starts.

TODO-9:
[]What happens if the user enters a number/symbol/space that's not in the List alphabet?

TODO-10:
[]Can you fix the code to keep the number/symbol/space when the text is encoded/decoded?
